Was bored one night, then i remembered that my friend  struggled with a school project to make a game in p5 canvas. Cost me a few hours and accidently liked an old vm (voicemessage, not virtual machine :D)... 

But yeah.... would be nice with a more event-driven architecture and perhaps a more stricter mvc format.
Graphics are fine :)

- [ ] Fully functional mines, that dissapears after a while or when hit
- [ ] Fully functional surface hunters
- [ ] Game over screen
- [ ] More gamey, ie score, timer etc
- [ ] Game finished after above, the stuff under is just nice to have 
- [ ] Ability to shoot back
- [ ] Testing
